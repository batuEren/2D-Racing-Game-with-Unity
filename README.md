# 2D-Racing-Game-with-Unity
This is a game I made when I was 14. It is a fun arcade racing game to play with a friend. It has three different racing styles:
1. F1 track racing - This is my favorite mode with an F1 style track and lots of grip.
2. Rally racing - This is the mode which I done lots of tournaments with my friends.
3. Oval racing - this isn't that fun.
Game is not in publishing standarts it contains some bugs but it is still fun.
